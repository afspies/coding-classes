# Programming in Python for Non-CS Majors

This repository contains all the material for [HackSoc Manchester's](www.hacksoc.com) classes on teaching Python to 
Non-CS Majors. The classes run over 12 weeks and cover everything from the basics of Python programming to conducting
data analysis. Since this is the first year such a series is being run, the course plan given below is tentative and might
undergo changes as the semester progresses. 

# Logistics

### When:

5PM-6PM, every Thursday. Starting on the 4th of October

### Where:

G41, [Kilburn Building](https://goo.gl/maps/PqCGgk4ngjP2). This location might change if we outgrow the space. Once you 
reach the Kilburn building, there will be signs/volunteers to guide you.

### Who:

The classes will be led by students in the School of CS. There will be volunteers as well to help troubleshoot
any issues that you might face. Some sessions might also be lead by people from the tech industry.

### What should I install?

- Python 3: You can either install the latest Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Any version
over 3.6 is fine) or the 
[Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) which contains libraries that become relevant later on
in the course and will allow you to run the notebooks we prepare for the classes. We have put together a guide for it [here.](week0/anaconda-setup.md)
- A text-editor with autocomplete features. Some good free ones are available [here](https://atom.io), 
[here](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).

# Recommended Reading (to be updated as we go along):

This isn't mandatory, since we'll cover some of this stuff in class. However, it helps to gain an understanding of the 
larger ecosystem surrounding the tools we'll introduce.
