TAs



**Piazza**  
  
This term we will be using the Q&A Platform **Piazza** for class discussions. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, and the TAs \(anonymously if you prefer\). Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff or asking us on Facebook, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.
