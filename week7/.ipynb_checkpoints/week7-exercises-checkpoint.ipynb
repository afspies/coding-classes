    "# Python Week 7 - Exercises\n",
    "This week, the main goal of the exercises is to get you familiar with using **documentation** for packages; an essential skill for working on real world projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numpy\n",
    "Before we begin giving our turtle orders, we're going to have a go at installing a commonly used package for maths, especially linear alegbra (vectors, arrays, metrices etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the numpy package from the command line or terminal (depending on your operating system) using **pip install numpy**\n",
    "    * NOTE: If you get an error saying that PIP isn't installed, refer to the extra section at the end of this sheet for help (or ask a TA!)\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Create a new python script, which imports numpy and creates a numpy array containing ones (this should be two lines of code)\n",
    "    * See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Search google for *\"Create array of random numbers in numpy\"* and try and find a way of creating an array containing 10 random numbers in your script \n",
    "    * print() the array, and run the code a few times to make sure it's working\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Turtle time\n",
    "Now for the fun stuff. You'll need to make extensive use of the turtle documentation for these exercises: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try some triangles\n",
    "Create a basic turtle script (similar to the one in the lectures notes - see the turtle_example.py file in the github repository) which draws a triangle and fills it with a color of your choice.\n",
    "1. Start with an equilateral triangle\n",
    "2. Try to make an almost-perfect (no overshooting lines) isoceles triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge : Pythagorean Perfection\n",
    "This is essentially a maths challenge - don't try this during the session! \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function which takes three angles and a base length. Then use these angles and the base length (i.e. length of the \"bottom\" of the triangle) to draw a perfect (no overshooting lines) triangle.\n",
    "* Ensure that the the triangle you're trying to draw is mathematically valid (i.e. what do angles in a normal triangle add up to?)\n",
    "* In order to work out the lengths of the triangle's other edges, you'll want to use trigonmetric functions - Numpy can help you here [Make sure you're working in degrees, not radians]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretty patterns\n",
    "1. Using a for loop, create a nice repeated pattern (like a star)\n",
    "    * Maybe the turtle documentation has some useful examples ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge: Symmetry makes me happy\n",
    "1. Using a while loop, create a closed (i.e. the turtle ends where it started) pattern\n",
    "    * You'll want to make use of the fact that you can get the turtle's coordinate position using some of the package's functions\n",
    "2. If your pattern makes use of a repeated number (e.g. turning by a fixed angle many times), wrap it up in the function and allow the user to play around with the value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solar System\n",
    "*Check the turtle documentation for a way of drawing circles*\n",
    "Draw a yellow sun with a green earth some distance away, and show the orbit of the earth by drawing a black circle along its path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge : Animate\n",
    "* Try and find a way to make the turtle move so quickly that it draws the entire solar system almost instantly\n",
    "* Then try and find a way to \"clear the screen\" and hide the turtle\n",
    "* Now think of a clever way to repeatedly draw the entire solar system, whilst moving the earth slightly further in its orbit, so that it looks like the earth is actually moving \n",
    "Hint: To make your animation run at a nice rate, you might want to consider using the time package's \"time.sleep()\" function\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra\n",
    "## PIP Installation\n",
    "If your computer doesn't have pip installed, dependant on your operating system, do the following:\n",
    "### Windows \n",
    "(This is a pain, so you'll probably just want to get a TA to do it for you to save time)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py as get-pip.py and then run it using python in the command line.\n",
    "2. Open a command prompt window as administrator (using the ctrl+shift+enter shortcut)\n",
    "3. Try and run \"easy_install pip\" - This will likely not work\n",
    "4. Enter the directory containing the file via the \"cd\" command in the command prompt\n",
    "5. Run the file using \"python get-pip.py\"\n",
    "6. Add the folder containing the pip scripts (usually \"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\") to your PATH enviroment - this is a mild pain\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully you're done!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux/Mac\n",
    "1. run \"sudo easy_install pip\" from the terminal\n",
    "2. If that didn't work, try \"sudo python -m ensurepip\"\n",
    "3. If that didn't work, shout at a TA (preferably Luke)"
