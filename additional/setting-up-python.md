# Setting up Python

## Anaconda Python Distribution

We'll be using the anaconda python distribution which comes with the **Spyder** **IDE** \(Integrated development environment\) and a number of useful data-science packages which we'll use later on in the course.

To install  Anaconda, simply go to [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) and download the **Python 3.7** version relevant to your operating system.
