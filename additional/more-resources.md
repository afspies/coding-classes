## Reference

### **W3 Schools Python Syntax Tutorials**

As a reference source for brief and clear summaries of different pieces of Python syntax, with interactive examples, we recommend using W3 School's Python tutorials.

### Stackoverflow

Any problems you encounter which don't seem to have a trivial solution have probably been seen by someone else before - if you're lucky, they'll have posted about it on stackoverflow and gotten someone's advice.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even experienced programmers often use stackoverflow to find solutions to bugs, and then simply copy-paste these into their own code. This is a **bad idea** - always try to _understand the solution_. Then if you encounter a similar problem in the future, or have to adjust the existing solution, you won't be at a complete loss.

## Further Learning

Great Python 2 Course with plenty of exercises \(there are some minor syntax differences between Python 2 and Python 3\).

### **Harvard** CS50

Much of this course is based on the materials used in Harvard's acclaimed CS50 course - these are available online and offer a lot of details which we omit.
